working against the test example. need to handle escapes \" in strings and fix tokenizer for empty strings

keep adding to the test example more features of the jack language.

## todo

* escape to xml entities quotes and pointy brackets
* handle nested multi line comments
* strange bug in the second return; statement, token gets lost? (then has invalid term)
